/*
Topic: Data Structures and Algorithms
Learning Goal: Understand this concept with a runnable example.
Approach: Read main() first, then helper function(s), then modify sample input.
Time Complexity: Analyze the core operation in this file while practicing.
Space Complexity: Check recursion/auxiliary data structure usage.
How to Run: Compile and run this file; verify output shown in terminal.
Practice Task: Change inputs and test at least 3 edge cases.
